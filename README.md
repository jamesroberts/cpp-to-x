# cpp-to-x
A simple C++ library with multi language interfaces (Java, NodeJS, Python...)

## Why

This is just a learning experiment to see how you can write code once, in a powerful general purpose language like C++ and then use that code in many other languages (Node, Java and Python).

## Java Example

```bash
cd java/
./run.sh
```

## Node Example

```bash
cd node/
./run.sh
```
